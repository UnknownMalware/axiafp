    <p> Feel free to change the functions in the demonstration. (Note: F(x) is the antiderivative of f(x), so it should be differentiable) </p>
    <p> In the folder titled "First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus", the function \(\frac{d}{dx}\int _a^x f(t)dt\) is defined. If you change the function, you'll notice that this function always exactly overlaps \(f(x)\).</p>
    <p> In the folder titled "Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus", you'll notice that the two expressions \(\int _a^b f(x)dx\) and \(F(b)-F(a)\) always evaluate to the same value, regardless of the function or the bounds.</p>

    <h2> What is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus? </h2>
    <p> 
      There are actually two Fundamental Theorems of Calculus, both of which establish a relationship between functions, their derivatives, and their antiderivatives. 
      The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states the relationship between the rate of change of the area under a function, (the integral), and the function itself.    
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="equation">
      \(\frac{d}{dx}\int _a^x f(t)dt = f(x)\)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Here we see that the rate of change of the area under a function is equal to the function. That makes sense, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      The second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives us a way to evaluate definite integrals by establishing a relationship between the area under a function, and the value of the antiderivative at the endpoints.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="equation">
      \(\int _a^b f(x)dx = F(b)-F(a)\)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      This equation tells us that the value of a definite integral is equal to the difference in the endpoints of the antiderivative
    </p>

    <h2> Proof of the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus </h2>
    <p> Let's prove the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, seen below: </p> <br>
    <p class="equation">
      \(\frac{d}{dx}\int _a^x f(t)dt = f(x)\)
    </p> <br>
    <p> First, we can rewrite the expression \(\frac{d}{dx}\int _a^x f(t)dt\) using the limit definition of a derivative </p> <br>
    <p class="equation">
      \(\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{\int_a^{x+\Delta x} f(t)dt - \int_a^xf(t)dt}{\Delta x}\)
    </p> <br>
    <p>
      Using the properties of integrals, we can simplify the top expression, resulting in the following:
    </p> <br>
    <p class="equation">
      \(\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{\int_x^{x+\Delta x} f(t) dt}{\Delta x}\)
    </p> <br>
    <p>
      Assuming that \(f(x)\) is continuous on \([x, x+\Delta x]\), by the MVT for Integrals we can say there exists a value c in that interval such that \(\int_x^{x+\Delta x} f(t) dt = f(c)\cdot \Delta x\).
      This means that we can rewrite our limit as the following:
    </p> <br>
    <p class="equation">
      \(\lim\limits_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{f(c)\cdot \Delta x}{\Delta x} = \lim\limits_{\Delta x\to 0}f(c)\)
    </p> <br>
    <p>
      Since c is between \(x\) and \(\Delta x\), \(\lim\limits_{\Delta x\to 0}x = x\), and \(\lim\limits_{\Delta x\to 0}x+\Delta x = x\)
    </p> <br>
    <p class="equation">
      By squeeze theorem, \(\lim\limits_{\Delta x\to 0}c = x\)
    </p> <br>
    <p>
      Therefore, \(\lim\limits_{\Delta x\to 0}f(c) = f(x)\), and we have shown that \(\frac{d}{dx}\int _a^x f(t)dt = f(x)\)
    </p> <br>
