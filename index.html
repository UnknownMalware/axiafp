    <h2> What is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus? </h2>
    <p> 
      There are actually two Fundamental Theorems of Calculus, both of which establish a relationship between functions, their derivatives, and their antiderivatives. 
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us states the relationship between the rate of change of the area under a function, (the integral), and the function itself.    
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      \(\frac{d}{dx}\int _a^x f(t)dt = f(x)\)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we see that the rate of change of the area under a function is equal to the function. That makes sense, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      The second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives us a way to evaluate definite integrals by establishing a relationship between the area under a function, and the value of the antiderivative at the endpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\int _a^b f(x)dx = F(b)-F(a)\)
